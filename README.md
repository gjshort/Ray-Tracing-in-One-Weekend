# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

This is my code from following along with Peter Shirley's short book:
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
Essentially, all of the code is his from the book, but I worked to understand what every part of the program does by sketching little diagrams, deriving equations myself, trying to write bits of code on my own, and making sense of each line of code in the text. 

Once I got portions of the code working, I played around with different features to more fully understand the program. I generated the "Surface Normal Caterpillar" image around halfway through the book and then copied the code to form the shapes for the "Final Render" image at the end.

The one feature I didn't implement was the glass portion since I just wanted to see how a ray tracer was implemented. I learned the simple refraction and optical physics in school.
